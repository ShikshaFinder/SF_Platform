      We guarantee results from our marketing platform, ensuring a minimum
      number views of banner ads and video ads and numbers of forms filled by
      the user. In order to qualify for this guarantee, clients must meet
      certain requirements. Firstly, clients must have submitted demo lectures
      showcasing their school's educational offerings. Additionally, they should
      accurately provide the location and name of their school. If clients
      choose to include video ads, it is essential that these videos contain at
      least one clear call to action prompting viewers to fill out the provided
      admission form/visit the redirect url. While clients can mention their
      school's fees in the video, the actual fees charged must align with the
      information provided in the video and any other details shared by the
      client.The fees of the respective institute must comply with the limits
      set by the Government of India at the time of placing ads. Moreover,
      clients should ensure that all school details are accurately provided. By
      adhering to these guidelines, clients can maximize their chances of
      receiving the guaranteed number of filled admission forms through our
      marketing platform. Any content in the marketing materials that
      discourages or asks viewers not to fill out the admission form is strictly
      prohibited. Our aim is to generate genuine interest and encourage
      potential students to take the necessary steps to apply. Violation of this
      guideline may result in the termination of the marketing partnership &
      guarantee agreement. It is the responsibility of clients to provide
      accurate and truthful content, including demo lectures, location and
      school details, and video ads. Any legal disputes or problems arising from
      the content will be the sole responsibility of the clients. The owners of
      the websites reserve the right to change the terms and conditions at any
      time. For guaranteed views and form completions, time is not a factor; it
